# Fitness Tracker App - Goal Management Feature

Welcome to the Fitness Tracker App Goal Management feature! This part of the application allows users to set and manage their fitness goals.

## Overview

In the Fitness Tracker App, users can add new goals to their goal list. Before adding a new goal, the application checks for duplicates to ensure each goal is unique.

## How It Works

1. **Retrieve Existing Goals**:
   - The application retrieves all existing goals from the goal list.

2. **Check for Duplicates**:
   - It iterates through each existing goal to check if it matches the new goal input provided by the user.
   - If a duplicate goal is found, the application displays an alert informing the user that the goal already exists and prevents the addition of a duplicate goal.

3. **Add New Goal**:
   - If no duplicate is found, the application proceeds to add the new goal to the goal list.
   - It creates a new list item (`<li>`) for the new goal and appends it to the goal list.

## Usage

To use the Goal Management feature:

1. Enter your new goal in the input field.
2. Click the "Add Goal" button to add the goal to your goal list.
3. If the goal is unique, it will be added to the list. Otherwise, an alert will notify you that the goal already exists.

## Installation

To integrate the Goal Management feature into your Fitness Tracker App:

1. Ensure you have the necessary HTML structure with elements such as `goalList`, an input field for entering goals, and a button for adding goals.
2. Copy the provided JavaScript code snippet into your application's JavaScript file.
3. Ensure that the code snippet is executed when appropriate, such as when the "Add Goal" button is clicked.
